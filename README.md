<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
R: https://input-component-f6669.web.app

- What was your experience?
R:Just like the previous Button Component challenge, this one was also very simple, which took me less time because I didn't need to rack my brains by adding frivolous things that would have no use in a real project, so I decided to focus this time only on the part that matters

- What have you learned/improved?
R:I improved my concepts with componentization, I discovered new things it can do, and I was able to improve my skills with it

- Your wisdom? :)
R:Even though it's a simple project, it's a real project, that is, do it with care and thinking that it can save you a lot of work in the future.
